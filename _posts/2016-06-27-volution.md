my thoughts on people have changed drastically in years. at the begining of my medical school journey i was very idealistic; i wanted to save the world. nowadays i am really starting to understand what it takes for what i desired earlier. it's impossible, and unneccessary too.

if any design isn't effective anymore, wouldn't be new versions seeked?
