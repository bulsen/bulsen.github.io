title: Fetch, my bloody search thing

it's been several years since i published my first search engine, Fetch. it actually not a real search engine, just a better indexer and better at memorizing things than me.before i decided to write fetch first i tried to solve this problem with an conventional aspect; Ctrl+F. it was such a boring process. i was opening nearly every presentation and using that macro. then i tried to cache the slides, with grouping the data. this method was a little faster but even harder than the last one. it was taking me for several hours for searching specific things; was that even worth it? 

at last i couldn't stand that nonsense anymore and created Fetch. it is so simple; since you feed the fetch with your slides, it mines them and pushes them to the database. when you want to do a search just run the server and open the browser. fetch will give you the extracted pages, also you can roam between pages on browser.

after years i downloaded the code and 'refurbished' the code, made it a little faster. so i wrote this page.

so this is another flask and mongodb project.
